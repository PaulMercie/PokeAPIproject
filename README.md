# PokéAPI

We had an assignment in dev class, create something with the PokéAPI. I chose to make a pokédex listing the first generation of pokémon because it is this one that I played with throughout my childhood. In addition, in order to offer a more complete rendering, I added a listing by category of the 950+ items available in the game. This allowed me to develop my skills in php, both in practice and in information retrieval.
Since style was not the goal of this project, I chose to use just enough to make my work effective and show my work in php.
I've create a database for the Search Bar but i've encounter issues to link the informations between the database and the result of the API so i've created a simple searchbar.

## Installation

Just download the file and have fun with my site ! 

## Requirements

* A modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox & Safari).
* A functioning mouse.
* A screen size over 1380px/969px or it won't be functional. (Optimal 1400px/969px)

## !!! If the menu does not open 

Don't panic! Don't panic! This is a problem that can occur if the request to get the pokémons is too long, to solve the problem, you just need to refresh the page once. (If the menu when you click on the objects or pokémons opens, it means that everything is well loaded).
The load of the items usually working well.

## Features

* Search Bar : Use it to search for the first generation pokémon of your choice.
* Information retrieval : Allows to retrieve pokémon names from the API url.
* Creating new URLs : Allows you to retrieve information from new links such as sprites or specificities.
* Using the cache : Allows you to save the information once the loading is complete in order to avoid a new loading at each page reload.
* Creation of different fonctions in order to retreive the correct number of informations each time.
* Pokédex : Click on the pokémon of your choice to learn more about it. It open a little menu from the right where the informations are written.
